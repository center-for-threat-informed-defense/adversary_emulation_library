# Machine-Readable APT29 Emulation Plans

The universal, technology-agnostic version of the APT29 emulation plan YAML has been provided as starting point for machine parsing and execution of the APT29 emulation plan. This folder will store all versions of this yaml file, including those formatted to work with specific execution runners (such as automated agents like [CALDERA](https://github.com/mitre/caldera) or other breach simulation frameworks).

## Included Formats

As new files are added, please list them in the below table.

| File | Execution Framework | Notes |
