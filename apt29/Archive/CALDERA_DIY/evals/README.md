# CALDERA plugin: evals  (ARCHIVED)

## Overview

This repository contains the evals plugin for [CALDERA](https://github.com/mitre/caldera/wiki).
This [plugin](https://caldera.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Learning-the-terminology.html#what-is-a-plugin) contains the TTPs used within the ATT&CK Evaluations round 2 (APT29) and round 1 (APT3).
For more information, please see the [evaulations website](https://attackevals.mitre-engenuity.org/about).

**Please read this README.md in its entirety to avoid missing crucial steps when executing an adversary.**

## Initial CALDERA Installation
1. Clone CALDERA 2.6.6
```
git clone https://github.com/mitre/caldera.git --recursive --branch 2.6.6 && sudo ./install.sh
```

2. Clone the Eval plugin into the caldera/plugins directory
```commandline
git clone https://github.com/mitre-attack/attack-arsenal.git && cp -R attack-arsenal/adversary_emulation/APT29/CALDERA_DIY/evals caldera/plugins/ && cd caldera
```

3. Add the eval plugin to CALDERA config `conf/local.yml`
```yaml
plugins:
  - evals
```

## Round 2 Adversary
The APT29 adversary is broken up into three separate CALDERA [adversaries](https://caldera.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Learning-the-terminology.html#what-is-an-adversary) that execute commands in different phases.
Under the operation panel you will see these phases listed as **APT29 - Day 1.A**, **APT29 - Day 1.B**, and **APT29 - Day 2**.
Leverage the appropriate CALDERA [SANDCAT](https://caldera.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Plugin-library.html?highlight=sandcat#sandcat-54ndc47) [groups](https://caldera.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Learning-the-terminology.html#what-is-a-group) for each operational phase.
Prior to running an [operation](https://caldera.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Learning-the-terminology.html#what-is-an-operation), please consult the environment setup steps below.

### Environment Setup - Evals Round 2 - APT29 
Consult the [ATT&CK EVALUATION's Environment](https://attackevals.mitre-engenuity.org/APT3/environment) web page for a reference guide on how to replicate the range environment.
Ensure that all A/V is disabled within the environment to successfully replicate the EVALS environment.

- On your day 2 initial host you will need to manually browse to ```C:\Windows\Temp``` via ```Windows Explorer``` and accept the prompt.

Requirements for the round 2 adversary are the following:
- Initial host exists within a Windows domain.
- Install Google Chrome on the target.

- OneDrive account for data exfil.
    - *Failing to setup a OneDrive account will result only in an exfiltration ability failing, but the entire plugin can still run.*
<br />

- Disabling A/V products on host.
    - *Failing to disable A/V products on the host will likely resolve in payloads being removed before abilities are executed.*

**It is recommended that you first execute the evals plugin in an isolated-test environment to fully understand the TTPs performed on hosts, as well as the artifacts left behind.**

#### Setting Up CALDERA Facts
Next, update the [CALDERA facts](https://caldera.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Learning-the-terminology.html#what-is-a-fact) located here ```./data/sources/4fb34bde-b06d-445a-a146-8e35f79ce546.yml```
with the appropriate values for your environment. Keys to update include:

* Update ```target.domain.name``` to your environment's domain name.
* Update ```target.winrm.username``` to an administrator account you will later laterally move to.
* Update ```target.winrm.password``` to the administrators password used by ```target.winrm.username``` (**THIS WILL BE STORED IN PLAINTEXT**).
* Update ```target.winrm.remote_host``` to the remote host with winrm enabled for lateral movement.
* Update ```pivot_machine_hostname``` to the hostname of a Windows host for lateral movement via psexec.
* Update ```profile_user``` as the initial user the first SANDCAT agent  will be spawning under.
* Update ```profile_user_password```to the ```profiler_user```'s password (**THIS WILL BE STORED IN PLAINTEXT**).
* Update ```profile_user_day2``` to another user within the domain.
* Update ```profile_user_password_day2``` to ```profile_user_day2```'s password (**THIS WILL BE STORED IN PLAINTEXT**).
* Update ```onedrive.url``` to a OneDrive url.
* Update ```onedrive.username``` to a OneDrive account that will be used for data exifiltration.
* Update ```onedrive.password``` to the ```onedrive.username```'s password (**THIS WILL BE STORED IN PLAINTEXT**).


#### Setting Up the CALDERA Server
After initially cloning the CALDERA server, modify the ```conf/default.yml``` and set the CALDERA server's IP and port.

* ```vim ./conf/default.yml```

*Note, this is a relative path from the plugin's location.*

#### Setting Up Payloads
Prior to executing any of the commands listed below, certain payloads must be configured with your CALDERA server's IP address and port.
To accomplish this, use the ```setup.py```. Python script located in the payloads directory of the evals’ plugin to dynamically
update the payloads to the appropriate IP and port.

* ```cd plugins/evals/ && python3 ./payloads/setup.py```


### Starting CALDERA
Activate the Python virtual environment created by `install.sh`.

* ```cd ../../ && source ./calderaenv/bin/activate```

Start a fresh instance of CALDERA.

* ```python3 server.py --fresh```

### EVALs Round 2 - APT 29  Operation Steps
The APT29 [adversary profile](https://caldera.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Learning-the-terminology.html#what-is-an-adversary) is broken down into three separate adversary profiles.
These profiles include **APT29 Day-1 A**, **APT29 Day-1 B - Lateral Movement**,  and **APT29 Day-2**.
To successfully replicate the ATT&CK evals process, an environment setup like the one outlined in the environment setup section is assumed.

#### APT29 Day 1.A
Perform the following steps to get started with the APT29 adversary profiles:

1. Start a SANDACAT agent with elevated privileges. To do so, copy the SANDCAT cradle from the agent’s tab
and execute in an elevated user’s PowerShell prompt.

![img-1](./imgs/1-caldera.png)

![img-2](./imgs/2-caldera.png)

![img-3](./imgs/3-caldera.png)

Before hitting "enter" within the PowerShell prompt, you should change the default group from **"red"** to something more descriptive
such as **"red-day-1-A"**. See the image below.

![img-4](./imgs/4-caldera.png)

At this point, you should then see an agent call back to your CALDERA server, which is visible under the "**agents**" tab.

2. Now that we have an agent, we can run an operation. Select "**APT29 Day-1 A**" from the operation page.

![img-8](./imgs/8-caldera.png)

3. Start the APT29 Day-1 operation.

---

#### APT29 Day 1.B - Lateral Movement
Additional agents will spawn from the **APT29 Day-1 A** operation including a SANDCAT agent renamed as "python.exe". 
This will be the starting for **APT29 Day-1 B**. To start **APT29 Day-1 B**, start another operation with the group the "python.exe" agent is in.
Agent metadata can be viewed by clicking on the process id within the CALDERA interface.

![img-10](./imgs/10-caldera.png)

![img-11](./imgs/11-caldera.png)

Now that we have verified the new agent exists, run a new operation using the **APT29 1.B - Lateral Movement** adversary profile.

---

#### APT29 Day 2
The  APT29 Day-2 adversary profile expects a new agent to be run on a new machine as a non-elevated user. 
Copy the SANDCAT cradle as previously done and execute in a non-administrator PowerShell prompt.

After completing all adversary steps outlined above, RDPing into the target host should trigger additional persistence mechanisms.
