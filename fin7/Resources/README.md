Please note that binary executable files hosted here have been added to password protected zip files.  The password for these files is "malware."

We provide a [script](/Resources/utilities/crypt_executables.py) to automatically decrypt these files:

```
$ cd carbanak

$ python3 Resources/utilities/crypt_executables.py -i ./ -p malware --decrypt
```
