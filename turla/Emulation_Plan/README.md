# Turla Emulation Plans

An **emulation plan** is the primary document used to execute the red team scenario during a purple team operation. This document includes red team execution commands, links to source code, ATT&CK techniques leveraged, and CTI reporting references.

When we have multiple emulation plans, we break these plans into scenarios and provide a description of the plan's focus. 

| Emulation Plan | CTI Operations Flow | Description |
| ----------------- | ------------------- | ----------- |
| [Carbon Scenario](./Carbon_Scenario/) | [Carbon Operations Flow](../Operations_Flow/Carbon_Operations_Flow.md) | This directory contains the scenarios developed focusing on Turla's usage of Carbon. This plan was used to conduct ATT&CK Evaluations Enterprise Round 5 in 2023 |
| [Snake Scenario](./Snake_Scenario/) | [Snake Operations Flow](../Operations_Flow/Snake_Operations_Flow.md) | This directory contains the scenarios developed focusing on Turla's usage of Snake. This plan was used to conduct ATT&CK Evaluations Enterprise Round 5 in 2023. |
| [Caldera Support Files](./yaml/) |  | This directory contains the setup instructions and data for porting the above scenarios into Caldera |
