# Adversary Emulation Library

In collaboration with Center Participants, the [Center for Threat-Informed Defense
(Center)](https://ctid.mitre-engenuity.org/) maintains a library of adversary emulation
plans to allow organizations to evaluate their defensive capabilities against the
real-world threats they face. Emulation plans are an essential component in testing
current defenses for organizations that are looking to prioritize their defenses around
actual adversary behavior. Focusing our energies on developing a set of common emulation
plans that are available to all means that organizations can use their limited time and
resources to focus on understanding how their defenses actually fare against real-world
threats.

The library contains two types of adversary emulation plans: full emulation and micro
emulation.

**Full emulation plans** are a comprehensive approach to emulating a specific adversary,
e.g. [FIN6](/fin6/), from initial access to exfiltration. These plans emulate a wide
range of ATT&CK tactics & techniques and are designed to emulate a real breach from the
designated adversary.

**Micro emulation plans** are a focused approach to emulating compound behaviors seen
across multiple adversaries, e.g. [webshells](/micro_emulation_plans/src/webshell).
These plans emulate a small amount of ATT&CK techniques that are typically performed as
part of one adversary action.

## Philosophy

These adversary emulation plans are based on known-adversary behaviors and designed to
empower red teams to manually emulate a specific threat actor in order to test and
evaluate defensive capabilities from a threat-informed perspective. This approach
empowers defenders to operationalize cyber threat intelligence to better understand and
combat real-world adversaries. Rather than focusing on static signatures, these
intelligence-driven emulation plans provide a repeatable means to test and tune
defensive capabilities and products against the evolving Tactics, Techniques, and
Procedures (TTPs) of threat actors and malware.

## Adversary Emulation Background

Adversary emulation enables organizations to view their security through the eyes of a
cyber adversary with the goal of improving defenses across the adversary’s lifecycle. As
defenders this expands our attention and focus beyond just the final actions of the
adversary achieving their operational objective to rather understand and appreciate
every distinct behavior (that could have been detected and/or mitigated) leading up to
that point.

Each emulation plan is rooted in intelligence reports and other artifacts that capture
and describe breaches and campaigns publicly attributed to a specific named threat
actor. To develop each plan, we research and model each threat actor, focusing not only
on what they do (ex: gather credentials from victims) but also how (using what specific
tools/utilities/commands?) and when (during what stage of a breach?). We then develop
emulation content that mimics the underlying behaviors utilized by the threat actor
(i.e. not an exact representation, rather capturing the pertinent elements that
accurately generate appropriate test telemetry for defenders). This approach results in
nuanced emulation plans, each capturing unique scenarios and perspectives that we can
leverage as threat-informed defenders.

## Getting Started with Full Adversary Emulation Plans

As is the case with traditional red teaming and penetration testing, adversary emulation
is a specific style of offensive assessment performed to help us test and tune our
defenses. In this case, our objective is to operationalize cyber threat intelligence
describing behaviors observed in specific campaigns or malware samples. From this
intelligence, we select and execute a subset of behaviors (and their variations) to
assess our defenses from the perspective of the specific threat.

As described in the next section, each emulation plan captures specific threat
scenarios. These scenarios can be executed end-to-end, or individual behaviors can be
tested. Organizations can also choose to further customize the scenarios and/or
behaviors within each emulation plan to better fit their specific environment,
priorities, or to be shaped by additional intelligence.

In summary, each full emulation plan should be perceived as input to an offensive
assessment/red team. The content can be used as strict instructions to follow, or as
just a starting point to be built upon and personalized.

### Full Emulation Plan Structure

Each emulation plan focuses on a specific named threat actor. The README of each
individual plan provides a curated summary of available cyber threat intelligence,
composed of an intelligence overview of the actor (describing who they target, how, and
why where possible) as well as the scope of their activity (i.e. breadth of techniques
and malware used). All presented information is cited back to relevant publicly
available cyber threat intelligence and communicated and annotated via
[ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/).

Within each emulation plan, the operational flow provides a high-level summary of the
captured scenario(s). These scenarios will vary based on the adversary and available
intelligence, but typically follow a sequential progression of how the actor breaches
then works towards achieving their operational objectives within a victim environment
(espionage, data/system destruction, etc.).

The content to execute the scenario(s) is broken down into step-by-step procedures
provided in both human and machine-readable formats. Scenarios can be executed
end-to-end or as individual tests. The human-readable formats provide additional
relevant background where possible as well as any setup prerequisites, while the
machine-readable format is designed to be programmatically parsed (ex: read,
reformatted, and ingested into an automated agent, such as
[CALDERA](https://github.com/mitre/caldera) and/or breach simulation frameworks).

## Getting Started with Micro Emulation Plans

Similar to full emulation plans, micro emulation plans are a type of adversary emulation
that is designed to help us test and tune our defenses. However, these plans can be
executed without a red team and without the need for an offensive assessment. Each plan
is still composed of an intelligence overview for the behaviors being emulated, however
we are emulating behaviors that are common across multiple adversaries as opposed to a
singular adversary.

These plans are easy to execute, with no dependencies needed or special configuration of
your environment. All plans can be executed from either a standalone or networked
machine. They can be executed manually or integrated into automation software. We have
provided an example of how to execute a plan with
[CALDERA](/micro_emulation_plans/caldera-integration/), but these plans can be broadly
applied to other platforms.

Each micro plan has default runtime options, however, detailed instructions can be found
on the `README` for each plan on how to customize execution to fit your specific needs.
We have included the source code and `BUILD` instructions for each plan, so that they
can be modified and recompiled, as needed.

The micro plans can be downloaded from the [Releases
page](https://github.com/center-for-threat-informed-defense/adversary_emulation_library/releases).

## Future Work

The threat landscape changes every day, as new groups/malware emerge and known
adversaries adapt and evolve. The Center will continue to populate and maintain this
library to match this growth curve through dedicated research efforts that aim to either
create or update plans based on a specific adversary.
