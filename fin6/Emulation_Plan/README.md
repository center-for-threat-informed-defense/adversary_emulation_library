# FIN6 Adversary Emulation

This repository contains an adversary emulation plan for [FIN6](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0037/). This is the first emulation plan in a [library](https://github.com/center-for-threat-informed-defense/adversary_emulation_library) published by the [Center for Threat Informed Defense](https://mitre-engenuity.org/center-for-threat-informed-defense/) in cooperation with our participants. See our recent [blog](https://medium.com/mitre-engenuity/center-releases-fin6-adversary-emulation-plan-775d8c5ebe9b) announcing the release of this emulation plan and the [video walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5jeGSOyJzY&feature=youtu.be).

FIN6 is thought to be a financially motivated cyber-crime group. The group has aggressively targeted and compromised high-volume POS systems in the hospitality and retail sectors since at least 2015. FIN6 has targeted e-commerce sites and multinational organizations. Most of the group’s targets have been located in the United States and Europe, but include companies in Australia, Canada, Spain, India, Kazakhstan, Serbia, and China.<sup>[5](https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/threat-group/f8409554b71a79792ff099081bc5ac24)</sup>

The Intelligence Summary summarizes 15 publicly available sources to describe FIN6, their motivations, objectives, and observed target industries. It further describes the typical FIN6 Operational Flow along with their publicly attributed Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) mapped to ATT&CK.  In reviewing the plan, you may notice TTPs that do not currently map to the ATT&CK framework's FIN6 group profile.  This information has been provided to the ATT&CK team for analysis and potential incorporation.

The Operations Flow chains techniques together into a logical order of the major steps that commonly occur across FIN6 operations. In the case of FIN6, we describe their operations in two major phases:

- Phase 1: The primary focus of this phase is initial access and placement within the target environment, and exfiltrating relevant data identified during this phase (e.g. text files resulting from Discovery and credentials).
- Phase 2: This phase consists of the specific objectives or effects of the operation. We provide three potential options for specific objectives, based on historical FIN6 operations.

The FIN6 emulation plan is a human-readable, step-by-step / command-by-command implementation of FIN6 TTPs. Structurally, the plan is organized into 2 phases, as defined in the Operations Flow. The human-readable plan is accompanied by a machine-readable plan implemented in YAML. The YAML includes all steps, commands, and syntax for both Phase 1 and Phase 2. The YAML template was nuanced to ensure that each step within the YAML is directly coupled with its equivalent in the human-readable version.
